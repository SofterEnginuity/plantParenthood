## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Javascript

This project was created using a template, where I modified the text, images, layout and colors to fit my branding.

## Lessons Learned:
Templates can be fun, but sometimes it is best to build from scratch in order to get the results that I truly desire!
